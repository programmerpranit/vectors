                  <p>
                    A maximum of 6 team members are allowed in a team. A team
                    can participatewith a maximum of 2 cars. All cars will have
                    a different driver and once the driver name has beenfixed at
                    the start of the event it cannot be changed during the whole
                    event. Teams from different educational institutes can
                    participate.
                  </p>
                  <h2 class="pt-3">Car Dimensions:-</h2>
                  <p>
                    The car should fit in a box of dimensions 700mm x 500mm x
                    600mm throughout the race, excluding the external device
                    which is used to control the car.
                  </p>

                  <h2 class="pt-3">Gameplay</h2>
                  <p>
                    Each team will get Two trials. Each trial consists of Three
                    laps. The fastest trial will be considered. Only one member
                    will be allowed in the arena at a time. Checkpoints will be
                    placed throughout the arena. If a machine is stuck or falls
                    off the arena, that team will be allowed to pick it up and
                    place it at a checkpoint behind that point, the time for
                    which will be added to the total lap time. If any of the
                    cars starts off before the flag is waved, the counter would
                    be restarted and the car will get a second chance. However,
                    if any car starts off before the waving of flag (or
                    countdown) for a second time, it will be disqualified. Once
                    disqualified the team can't participate again in the event.
                  </p>

                  <h2 class="pt-3">Rules and Regulations:-</h2>
                  <p>
                    1. The teams must design a purely wireless remote-controlled
                    machine. <br />
                    2. The machine parts can be roughly classified into
                    structural and functional parts: Functional parts -
                    ready-made versions of Gears, differential gear, engine,
                    springs, shock absorbers, servo motors (non-propulsion
                    purposes only), batteries and wheels can be used. Structural
                    parts - Chassis, steering mechanism, shock towers and
                    suspension (excluding the upper suspension arm, suspension
                    spring and shock absorbers) have to be built by the
                    participants themselves. <br />
                    3. Judging for the same will be strict and the participant
                    will be immediately disqualified if any of the above
                    structural components are found to be readymade. <br />
                    4. Minimum thickness of tires is 3 inch. Selection of a good
                    width will ensure better performance in dirt tracks. <br />
                    5. Brake Mechanism: It is compulsory to incorporate a
                    braking mechanism in the car. Participants have to fabricate
                    the brake pad as a part of the braking mechanism. Any other
                    part used in braking mechanism (including the brake disk)
                    can be readymade. <br />
                    6. Wheel Hub: Any part rigidly attached to the wheel hub
                    will be considered as a part of it and hence can be
                    ready-made. E.g:- ball stud. <br />
                    7. Steering Mechanism: Any part which is connected to
                    steering rod rigidly i.e. has no degrees of freedom with
                    respect to steering rod will be considered as part of
                    steering rod and thus has to be fabricated by participants.
                    <br />
                    8. A team is disqualified if it takes any of the following
                    actions during the gameplay:-
                    <br />
                    - The team intentionally damages or tries to damage the
                    field, facilities, equipment or opponent’s car. <br />
                    - The team performs any acts that are not in the spirit of
                    fair play. <br />
                    - The team fails to obey instructions or warning issued by
                    referees. <br />
                    - If a car disintegrates in the arena leaving behind loose
                    parts the team will be disqualified. <br />
                    - Once the race begins team members will be immediately
                    disqualified if found touching their or opponent’s machine
                    <br />
                    - The organizers reserve the right to change the rules and
                    regulations of the competition at any time. All contestants
                    are expected to comply with any changes made by the
                    organizers. <br />
